          Before I got into web design & development, 
          I was exploring art & science,
          just asking "what can I build & share with friends?"
          <br />
          <br />
          After every challenge I dig into, 
          I focused on finding the right tools for the job.
          I start thinking "why this? why now? can I do it?"

          Every project I joined always treated it like a unit.
          When you get involved, we research, identify, & define the goal.
          When I start building on the MVP, I prioritize while considering UX thinking & UI principles.
