          When I started my journey into web development, 
          I realized "I can build anything!",
          but "what should I make?".
          <br />
          <br />
          With every challenge I go in search 
          for communities I like and I ask myself, 
          "why this? why now? why me?".
          <br />
          <br />
          It helps me align & partner up with 
          the ideal project worth creating.

          I help businesses make React UI libraries and features that can 
          improve on their current digital product.

          On every project, I plan to check for
          accessibility, compatibility, and performance.

          As I start building, I consider if it is
          responsive, reusable, and versatile.
