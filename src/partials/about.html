          When I started my journey into web development, 
          I realized "I can build anything!",
          but "what should I make?".
          <br />
          <br />
          With every challenge I go in search 
          for communities I like and ask them, 
          "why this? why now? why me?".
          <br />
          <br />
          It helps me align & partner up with 
          the ideal projects worth creating.

          When I work on projects, my overall plan is to check for 
          accessibility, compatibility, and performance.

          When I start executing, I consider if it is
          responsive, reusable, and versatile.
